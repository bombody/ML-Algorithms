class Retry(object):
    """ Retry configuration.

    Each retry attempt will create a new Retry object with updated values, so
    they can be safely reused.

    Retries can be defined as a default for a pool::

        retries = Retry(connect=5, read=2, redirect=5)
        http = PoolManager(retries=retries)
        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/')

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool)::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=Retry(10))

    Retries can be disabled by passing ``False``::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=False)

    Errors will be wrapped in :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` unless
    retries are disabled, in which case the causing exception will be raised.

    :param int total:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

        Set to ``None`` to remove this constraint and fall back on other
        counts. It's a good idea to set this to some sensibly-high value to
        account for unexpected edge cases and avoid infinite retry loops.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int connect:
        How many connection-related errors to retry on.

        These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,
        which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int read:
