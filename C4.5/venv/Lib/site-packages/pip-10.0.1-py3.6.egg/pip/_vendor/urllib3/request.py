class RequestMethods(object):
    """
    Convenience mixin for classes who implement a :meth:`urlopen` method, such
    as :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` and
    :class:`~urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager`.

    Provides behavior for making common types of HTTP request methods and
    decides which type of request field encoding to use.

    Specifically,

    :meth:`.request_encode_url` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the URL (such as GET, HEAD, DELETE).

    :meth:`.request_encode_body` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the *body* of the request using multipart or www-form-urlencoded
    (such as for POST, PUT, PATCH).

    :meth:`.request` is for making any kind of request, it will look up the
    appropriate encoding format and use one of the above two methods to make
    the request.
