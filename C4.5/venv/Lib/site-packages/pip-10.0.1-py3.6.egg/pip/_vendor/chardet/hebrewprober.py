# This prober doesn't actually recognize a language or a charset.
# It is a helper prober for the use of the Hebrew model probers

### General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition ###
#
# Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:
# "ISO-8859-8" - Visual Hebrew
# "windows-1255" - Logical Hebrew
# "ISO-8859-8-I" - Logical Hebrew
# "x-mac-hebrew" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??
#
# Both "ISO" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas
# "windows-1255" and "x-mac-hebrew" are two different proper supersets of
# these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range
# 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific
# diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.
# x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different
# mapping.
#
# As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four
# charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the
# main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters
# (including final letters).
#
# The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.
# "Visual" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is
# not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and
# draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read
# backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:
# "[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards
# and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards]
# [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' "
# adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is
# naturally also "visual" and from left to right.
#
# "Logical" directionality means the text is ordered "naturally" according to
# the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display
# the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general
# punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.
#
# Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From
# what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality
# is Logical.
#
# To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two
# charsets:
# Visual Hebrew - "ISO-8859-8" - backwards text - Words and sentences are
#    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes
#    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even
#    word order is unimportant).
# Logical Hebrew - "windows-1255" - normal, naturally ordered text.
#
# "ISO-8859-8-I" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be
#    specifically identified.
# "x-mac-hebrew" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew
#    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with
#    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might
#    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact
#    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't
#    worth the effort and performance hit.
#
#### The Prober ####
#
# The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,
# all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the
# SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in
# fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which
# one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores
# with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.
#
# The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML
# tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces
# and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.
# The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in
# high-ASCII.
# The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:
# Win1255Model.
# The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other
# SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was
# built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter
# lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates
# a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.
#
# The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for
# final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual
# Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber
# alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence
# since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the
# HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper "Name Prober".
# When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,
# it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a
# Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the
# HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the
# decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both
# model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the
# charset identified, either "windows-1255" or "ISO-8859-8".
